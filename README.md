## 🎯 Overview

The **Student Performance Prediction System** is a comprehensive machine learning application designed to help educators, administrators, and researchers predict student academic outcomes based on various factors including:

- 📚 Study habits and time investment
- 📊 Historical academic performance
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Socioeconomic factors (parental education, internet access)
- 🏃‍♂️ Lifestyle factors (sleep, physical activity, extracurriculars)
- 🎯 Support systems (tutoring availability)

Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive user interface and **scikit-learn** for robust machine learning capabilities, this tool enables early identification of at-risk students and data-driven interventions.
